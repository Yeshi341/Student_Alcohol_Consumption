## Business Problem

Alcohol is the most prevalent and commonly used substance among the youth in most countries around the world today. According to the cdc website on [Underage Drinking](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/underage-drinking.htm) "Underage drinking is a significant public health problem in the U.S. Excessive drinking is responsible for more than 3,500 deaths and 210,000 years of potential life lost among people under age 21 each year.1 Underage drinking cost the U.S. $24 billion in 2010.2 There were approximately 119,000 emergency rooms visits by persons aged 12 to 21 for injuries and other conditions linked to alcohol in 2013." Therefore, Alcohol Consumption among students is a most necessary and important subject to be researched. 
This project will attempt to identify the factors that influence this behavior among students.
